/* Problem Statement
 *     
 * Let's say you have a binary string such as the following:
 * 	011100011
 * One way to encrypt this string is to add to each digit the sum of its 
 * adjacent digits. For example, the above string would become:
 * 	123210122
 * In particular, if P is the original string, and Q is the encrypted string, 
 * then Q[i] = P[i-1] + P[i] + P[i+1] for all digit positions i. Characters 
 * off the left and right edges of the string are treated as zeroes.
 * An encrypted string given to you in this format can be decoded as follows (
 * using 123210122 as an example):
 *  1. Assume P[0] = 0.
 *  2. Because Q[0] = P[0] + P[1] = 0 + P[1] = 1, we know that P[1] = 1.
 *  3. Because Q[1] = P[0] + P[1] + P[2] = 0 + 1 + P[2] = 2, we know that P[2] = 1.
 *  4. Because Q[2] = P[1] + P[2] + P[3] = 1 + 1 + P[3] = 3, we know that P[3] = 1.
 *  5. Repeating these steps gives us P[4] = 0, P[5] = 0, P[6] = 0, P[7] = 1, and P[8] = 1.
 *  6. We check our work by noting that Q[8] = P[7] + P[8] = 1 + 1 = 2. Since 
 *     this equation works out, we are finished, and we have recovered one 
 *     possible original string.
 *
 * Now we repeat the process, assuming the opposite about P[0]:
 * 
 * 1. Assume P[0] = 1.
 * 2. Because Q[0] = P[0] + P[1] = 1 + P[1] = 1, we know that P[1] = 0.
 * 3. Because Q[1] = P[0] + P[1] + P[2] = 1 + 0 + P[2] = 2, we know that P[2] = 1.
 * 4. Now note that Q[2] = P[1] + P[2] + P[3] = 0 + 1 + P[3] = 3, which leads us 
 *    to the conclusion that P[3] = 2. However, this violates the fact that each 
 *    character in the original string must be '0' or '1'. Therefore, there 
 *    exists no such original string P where the first digit is '1'.
 *
 * Note that this algorithm produces at most two decodings for any given 
 * encrypted string. There can never be more than one possible way to decode 
 * a string once the first binary digit is set.
 * Given a String message, containing the encrypted string, return a String[] 
 * with exactly two elements. The first element should contain the decrypted 
 * string assuming the first character is '0'; the second element should 
 * assume the first character is '1'. If one of the tests fails, return the 
 * string "NONE" in its place. For the above example, you should return 
 * {"011100011", "NONE"}.
